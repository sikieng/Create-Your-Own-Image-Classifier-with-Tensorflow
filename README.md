# Create-Your-Own-Image-Classifier-with-Tensorflow


Image Classifier - TensorFlow Project
In this project, we will first develop code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow, then we will convert it into a command-line application.

We'll be using this dataset from Oxford of 102 flower categories. The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large that you cannot upload it onto Github.

Requirements
The project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed :

TensorFlow
NumPy
matplotlib
